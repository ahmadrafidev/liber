## Overview

Keeping documentation up-to-date can be a time-consuming challenge. Liber streamlines this process by parsing annotated code (e.g., JSDoc, Python docstrings, JavaDoc) and producing polished documentation in formats like web pages, PDFs, or markdown files. This ensures your team and external developers have access to clear, consistent, and searchable documentation.
